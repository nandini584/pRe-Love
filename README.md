# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# To get started first make another branch aside the main branch.
Run npm install to install all the necessary modules in your local server.

The web components are all in the "src" folder. 
All the parts load into the index.html file in public folder. It has Javascript injected to it by Index.js. We are using app.js to inject all the components like navbar and login pages to index.js.
 
We are using Tailwindcss in our project for most of the css.
Tailwind.config.js file contains all the tailwindcss addons inlcuding some  fonts colours etc. those are the theme fonts and colours we are using.
If you ever need to add something for css which is not  available in tailwind then just make a file global.css and use it for this work. 
All the css is to be imported in App.js.

**Map:**
1. Src folder is what you are going to work with. 
2. The componets folder contains all the props of the website.
3. Login and signup contains all the designing of login and signup section.
4. Navbar contains all the navbar detalis and its UI code majorly.
5. Tiles is the prop of each product and is to be displayed at a limit of 50 per page.

When you are done with the work please check it once more and then commit it into the main of your fork and make a PR of the work. All PRs are reviewed at 10 pm IST.
